# OBJECTIVE
In this project We have analyzed sales performance data for Amazon using SQL to understand product performance, Customer performance & impact of promotion.                                                                                                                                  
# What we did
We worked with sales data to uncover key insights about product revenue, Customer buying behaviour. We have discovered that 20% of the product generated 80% of the total revenue which illustrate the Pareto Principle. It is also known as 80/20 rule. Which means a few top selling product are making most of the money for Amazon. while there are many products only a small number are driving the biggest sales. This principle shows that a small percentage of product are responsible for most of the sales. Essentially focusing on these top products can have the biggest impact on revenue.

# Customer Preference
Our analysis revealed that 65% of customers preferred making cash. Our work involved creating database, performing feature engineering and analyze data to provide insights that help optimize marketing strategies & improve sales outcome.
